## Bio

I am a PhD student in the Interdisciplinary Engineering program at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, advised by [Auroop R. Ganguly](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ganguly-auroop/).

My research is focused on using machine learning to solve problems in environmental and climate science. I am currently interested in developing deep transfer learning methods for extracting information from remotely-sensed data. At other times, I also think about making general AI more interpretable and theory-guided.
