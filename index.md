My research focuses on using machine learning to solve problems in environmental and climate science. I am currently interested in developing deep transfer learning methods for extracting information from remotely-sensed data. At other times, I also think about making general AI more interpretable, data efficient and theory-guided.


## Bio

Nishant is a PhD student in the Interdisciplinary Engineering program at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, advised by [Auroop R. Ganguly](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ganguly-auroop/). Before starting his PhD, he worked in the industry where he evaluated the health of critical infrastructure systems. He completed his master's degree in intelligent systems from the University of Michigan Ann Arbor in 2014 and a bachelor's in civil and environmental engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati in 2012.
