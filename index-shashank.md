description: Remote Sensing, Vegetation Mapping and Data Science

---
My research is focused on monitoring vegetation with the help of remote sensing data and machine learning methods. I have experience working with earth observing data from different sensors (multispectral/hyperspectral), mounted on various platforms (spaceborne/airborne) and collected across different spatial scales (landscape to continental scales) to study diverse vegetation types (crops/arctic tundra shrubs). Through my collaborations with eminent scientists at reputed government agencies like NASA, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USDA Forest Service etc., I have tried to address the following research questions: 
* Continental-scale continuous mapping of vegetation in near real time - **“What is growing?”**
* Impact of growing conditions, including mean and extreme weather, on vegetation biomass - **“How much is growing and what is the expected yield?”** <br>

Over the years, I have built a strong background in the diverse areas of remote sensing, data science and machine learning, ecology and climate science, and I have presented my work at a variety of conferences, spanning different focus areas like Computer Science, Geophysics and Landscape Ecology.
